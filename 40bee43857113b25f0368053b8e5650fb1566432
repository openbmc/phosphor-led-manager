The consensus on Jayanth\u0027s work was that we would enable a very small set everywhere and then get more and more individual checks added to docs.  The problem is that there is no consistency on these and they lead to a bad developer experience.\n\n\u003e Can\u0027t we just drop the individual checks which are causing problems or fix the code if it\u0027s a valid issue?\n\nThe \"readability-named-parameter\" is the one that specifically pissed me off because it is a \"style policy\" that we do not have documented anywhere, breaks a development pattern in C++ (tag-dispatch), and is something the C++ standard explicitly allows over the C standard.\n\nI\u0027d rather we revert this to the consensus level checks rather than bicker about individual ones in individual repositories across the project.  Let\u0027s keep that discussion all in one place.  (btw, I\u0027m having very similar discussions at https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/pldm/+/73859 because they recently added a bunch of these to PLDM after we already had the project decision to have a common one.)",
