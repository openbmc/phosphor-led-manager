      "message": "The return type of a function does not usually need to be declared const, because the return value of a function is usually a temporary, read-only result of an expression. Declaring the return type of a function as const is usually redundant and may cause compiler optimizations to be blocked because the compiler may incorrectly believe that the return value needs to be protected from modification, even though it is actually just a temporary value.",

For `auto foo() const;`, it means that the member variables inside the function are not allowed to be modified (unless mutable is declared), so this method cannot be used for the loadJsonConfig and loadJsonConfigV1 methods because they modify the member variables of the class.",
