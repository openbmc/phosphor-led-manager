Before the default led priority has been ```Blink``` and  now it\u0027s become std::nullopt, meaning no led priority is assumed by default.\n\nWe can change it back if needed but i would need feedback on that. \n\nThe benefit of this is making configuration more explicit, as ```Blink``` Priority is an arbitrary choice.\n\nThe downside is the changed behavior.",
