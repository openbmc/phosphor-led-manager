If the configuration doesn\u0027t show up by this point, systemd is going to kill the application.\n\nI didn\u0027t think very hard about 30s.  I think 75-85 seconds could work?\n\n\u003e Shouldn\u0027t we just go ahead and claim the busname earlier so that systemd continues on\n\nI had the same thought and that would certainly be simpler.  I chose this route because it means we\u0027ll be moving startup object creation after claiming the busname which is problematic isn\u0027t it?",
